# CitiBikeAnalysisTableau

This repo contains the jupyter notebook used to prepare the data for the tableau dashboard. It also includes the analysis write-up.

Please note:  I did not include any of the data to avoid exceeding size limits on github.  The data used was 2019 - 2021 Citi Bike trip data files at https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data
